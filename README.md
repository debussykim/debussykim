<h1>Hey, there! 👋</h1>

I'm `Jihyun Kim` , a college student with a passion for becoming a web backend developer. My goal is to create web applications that make people's lives easier, and I always have a desire to learn and expand my knowledge. I believe that hard work is the key to becoming a successful developer. Rather than being a brilliant scientist or artist, my goal is to be a good engineer who aims for the highest quality.

<h2>🚀 My Skills</h2>

<h2>🌱 Always Learning</h2>
Developing a skill is like riding a bike 🚲, you may fall down a lot at first, but that's the best way to learn. I think the best developers are the ones who keep learning new things, so I'm constantly studying and exploring new technologies and trying to improve my skills.

<h2> 🌎 Let's Connect! </h2>

I'm always looking to connect with other developers and share knowledge.
